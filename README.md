# Statistical Arbitrage: Pairs Trading ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=arnavkohli.statistical-arbitrage-pairs-trading)

This project aims to perform statistical arbitrage backtesting on select stock pairs from the NIFTY 50 index.

## What is Statistical Arbitrage?

Statistical arbitrage, particularly in the context of pairs trading, exploits the cointegration between two stocks. It takes advantage of the inherent stationarity of cointegrated pairs by generating trading signals when their prices deviate from their historical relationship.

## How is Cointegration Detected?

There are several tests to detect cointegration, but this project utilizes the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test to identify cointegration between stock pairs.

## Approach

- We analyze stocks from the **NIFTY 50** index over the years **2017 to 2022**.
- Relationships between constituent stocks are observed, and pairs that pass the ADF test are shortlisted.
- The shortlisted pairs are backtested using data from the year **2023** to evaluate the strategyâ€™s performance.
- **Example**: Below is a screenshot from the backtesting process for the **ASIANPAINTS** and **BAJFINANCE** pair:

## Results

The following pairs were found to be cointegrated at a **99% confidence level**:

| **Column 1**                   | **Column 2**                   | **Column 3**                   |
